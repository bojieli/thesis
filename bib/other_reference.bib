	abstract = {In the foreseeable future, major cloud vendors will need to store multiple zettabytes of data in their cloud storage infrastructure. Like all storage, cloud storage systems need to trade performance for cost, and they currently achieve this by using storage tiers backed by different storage media. The ultimate goal for cloud storage would be to provide zero-cost storage with low access latencies and high throughput. But all the storage media being deployed in the cloud today were created before the cloud existed, and were designed to support many usage scenarios. With cloud storage, the focus is on cost, and storage needs to be designed to be right-provisionable. The limits of what is possible with existing storage technologies are being reached, and a new clean-slate approach is needed for cloud storage. Hence, the time is right to seek out a new physical media to underpin novel storage systems designed exclusively to support the cloud. In Project Silica, Microsoft Research and Southampton University, are exploring whether quartz glass could be the future media for mass storage in the cloud. In this paper, we describe the basis for the technology, and discuss conventional assumptions about storage that we are challenging in Project Silica.},

	abstract = {Interactive AI-powered services require low-latency evaluation of deep neural network (DNN) models—aka “realtime AI”. The growing demand for computationally expensive, state-of-the-art DNNs, coupled with diminishing performance gains of general-purpose architectures, has fueled an explosion of specialized Neural Processing Units (NPUs). NPUs for interactive services should satisfy two requirements: (1) execution of DNN models with low latency, high throughput, and high efficiency, and (2) flexibility to accommodate evolving state-of-the-art models (e.g., RNNs, CNNs, MLPs) without costly silicon updates. This paper describes the NPU architecture for Project Brainwave, a production-scale system for real-time AI. The Brainwave NPU achieves more than an order of magnitude improvement in latency and throughput over state-of-the-art GPUs on large RNNs at a batch size of 1. The NPU attains this performance using a single-threaded SIMD ISA paired with a distributed microarchitecture capable of dispatching over 7M operations from a single instruction. The spatially distributed microarchitecture, scaled up to 96,000 multiply-accumulate units, is supported by hierarchical instruction decoders and schedulers coupled with thousands of independently addressable high-bandwidth on-chip memories, and can transparently exploit many levels of fine-grain SIMD parallelism. When targeting an FPGA, microarchitectural parameters such as native datapaths and numerical precision can be “synthesis specialized” to models at compile time, enabling high FPGA performance competitive with hardened NPUs. When running on an Intel Stratix 10 280 FPGA, the Brainwave
	NPU achieves performance ranging from ten to over thirty-five teraflops, with no batching, on large, memory-intensive RNNs.},

	We deployed this design over a production server bed, and show how it can be used for both service acceleration (Web search ranking) and network acceleration (encryption of data in transit at high-speeds).  This architecture is much more scalable than prior work which used secondary rack-scale networks for inter-FPGA communication.  By coupling to the network plane, direct FPGA-to-FPGA messages can be achieved at comparable latency to previous work, without the secondary network.  Additionally, the scale of direct inter-FPGA messaging is much larger.  The average round-trip latencies observed in our measurements among 24, 1000, and 250,000 machines are under 3, 9, and 20 microseconds, respectively.   The Configurable Cloud architecture has been deployed at hyperscale in Microsoft's production datacenters worldwide.},

	abstract = {Cluster fabric interconnects that use 3D torus topologies are increasingly being deployed in data center clusters. In our prior work, we demonstrated that by using these topologies and letting applications implement custom routing protocols and perform operations on path, it is possible to increase performance and simplify development. However, these beneﬁts cannot be achieved using mainstream point-to-point networking stacks such as TCP/IP or MPI, which hide the underlying topology and do not allow the implementation of any in-network operations. In this paper we describe CamCubeOS, a novel key-based communication stack, purposely designed from scratch for 3D torus fabric interconnects. We note that many of the applications used in clusters are key-based. Therefore, we designed CamCubeOS to natively support key-based operations. We select a virtual topology that perfectly matches the underlying physical topology and we use the keyspace to expose the physical locality, thus avoiding the typical overhead incurred by overlay-based approaches. We report on our experience in building several applications on top of CamCubeOS and we evaluate their performance and feasibility using a prototype and large-scale simulations.},

	abstract = {
	
	A significant fraction of data stored in cloud storage is rarely accessed. This data is referred to as cold data; cost-effective storage for cold data has become a challenge for cloud providers. Pelican is a rack-scale hard disk based storage unit designed as the basic building block for exabyte scale storage for cold data. In Pelican, server, power, cooling and interconnect bandwidth resources are provisioned by design to support cold data workloads; this right-provisioning significantly reduces Pelican’s total cost of ownership compared to traditional disk-based storage.
	
	Resource right-provisioning in Pelican means only 8% of the drives can be concurrently spinning. This introduces complex resource management to be handled by the Pelican storage stack. Resource restrictions are expressed as constraints over the hard drives. The data layout and IO scheduling ensures that these constraints are not violated. We evaluate the performance of a prototype Pelican, and compare against a traditional resource overprovisioned storage rack using a cross-validated simulator. We show that compared to this over-provisioned storage rack Pelican performs well for cold workloads, providing high throughput with acceptable latency.

	Data compression techniques have been the subject of intense study over the past several decades due to exponential increases in the quantity of data stored and transmitted by computer systems. Compression algorithms are traditionally forced to make tradeoffs between throughput and compression quality (the ratio of original file size to compressed file size). FPGAs represent a compelling substrate for streaming applications such as data compression thanks to their capacity for deep pipelines and custom caching solutions. Unfortunately, data hazards in compression algorithms such as LZ77 inhibit the creation of deep pipelines without sacrificing some amount of compression quality. In this work we detail a scalable fully pipelined FPGA accelerator that performs LZ77 compression and static Huffman encoding at rates up to 5.6 GB/s. Furthermore, we explore tradeoffs between compression quality and FPGA area that allow the same throughput at a fraction of the logic utilization in exchange for moderate reductions in compression quality. Compared to recent FPGA compression studies, our emphasis on scalability gives our accelerator a 3.0x advantage in resource utilization at equivalent throughput and compression ratio.

	Rack-scale computers, comprising a large number of micro-servers connected by a direct-connect topology, are poised to replace servers as the building block in data centers. We focus on the problem of routing and congestion control across the rack's network, and find that high path diversity in rack topologies, in combination with workload diversity across it, means that traditional solutions are inadequate.
	
	We present R2C2, a network stack for rack-scale computers providing flexible and efficient routing and congestion control. R2C2 leverages the fact that rack topologies allow for low-overhead broadcasting to ensure that all nodes in the rack are aware of all network flows. We thus achieve rate-based congestion control without any probing; each node independently determines the sending rate for its flows while respecting the provider's allocation policies. For routing, nodes dynamically choose the routing protocol for their flows in order to maximize aggregate throughput. Through a prototype deployed across a rack emulation platform and a packet-level simulator, we show that R2C2 achieves very low queuing for diverse and bursty workloads, and that routing flexibility can provide significant throughput gains.

	year = {2019},
	month = {March},
	abstract = {FPGAs have been deployed at massive scale in data centers. Using currently available communication architectures, however, it is difficult for FPGAs to access and utilize the various heterogenous resources available in data centers (DRAM, CPU, GPU,...). In this paper, we present Direct Universal Access (DUA), a communication architecture that provides uniform access for FPGA to these data center resources.
	
	Without being limited by machine boundaries, DUA provides global names and a common interface for communicating across various resources, the underlying network automatically routing traffic and managing resource multiplexing. Our benchmarks show that DUA provides simple and fair-share resource access with small logic area overhead (&lt;10%) and negligible latency (&lt;0.2µs). We also build two practical multi-FPGA applications—deep crossing and regular expression matching—on top of DUA to demonstrate its usability and efficiency.},
