\section{Chapter Summary}
\label{socksdirect:sec:conclusion}

\sys {} is a high-performance user-space socket system compatible with Linux. To ensure the reliability of the control plane, this paper designs a monitoring daemon for each host; a point-to-point, synchronization-free data plane that fully supports fork and multi-threaded socket sharing; and a ring buffer that effectively utilizes shared memory and RDMA. \sys {} achieves performance close to hardware limits and improves the end-to-end performance of actual applications.

%\sys is a high performance user-space socket architecture that is compatible with existing applications and preserves isolation among processes, while being scalable to multiple cores and many concurrent connections. We carefully remove all major overheads in Linux socket.%\sys can significant reduce communication overhead, especially in a service oriented distributed system environment.
