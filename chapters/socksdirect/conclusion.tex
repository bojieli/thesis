\section{Conclusion}
\label{socksdirect:sec:conclusion}

\sys{} is a Linux compatible and high performance user-space socket system.
We design a per-host monitor daemon for trusted control plane;
a peer-to-peer synchronization-free data plane to fully support fork and multi-thread socket sharing;
and a ring buffer that utilizes shared memory and RDMA efficiently.
\sys{} achieves performance close to hardware limits and improves end-to-end performance of real-world applications.

%\sys is a high performance user-space socket architecture that is compatible with existing applications and preserves isolation among processes, while being scalable to multiple cores and many concurrent connections. We carefully remove all major overheads in Linux socket.%\sys can significant reduce communication overhead, especially in a service oriented distributed system environment.
