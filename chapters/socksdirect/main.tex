The content you've provided is LaTeX code, which is a typesetting system used for creating documents. The code you've provided doesn't contain any text that needs to be translated into English. It's mostly defining styles, colors, and new commands. 

For example, the command `\definecolor{mGreen}{rgb}{0,0.5,0}` is defining a new color named `mGreen` with the RGB values of 0, 0.5, 0. 

The command `\newcommand{\sys}{{\textsc{SocksDirect}}\xspace}` is defining a new command named `\sys` that will output the text "SocksDirect" in small caps.

The command `\newenvironment{icompact}` is defining a new environment for lists with specific parameters for parsep, partopsep, topsep, itemsep, parskip, and leftmargin.

If you have any text content in your LaTeX document that needs to be translated into English, please provide that.
