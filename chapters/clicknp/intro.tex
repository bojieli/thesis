\section{Introduction}

% cloud computing
Modern multi-tenant datacenters provide shared infrastructure for hosting many different types of services 
from different customers (\ie, tenants) at a low cost.
%
To ensure security and performance isolation, each tenant is deployed in a \textit{virtualized network} environment. 
% flexible network functions
Flexible network functions (NFs) are required for datacenter operators to enforce isolation 
while simultaneously guaranteeing Service Level Agreements (SLAs). 

% host networking and software network functions
Conventional hardware-based network appliances are not flexible, 
and almost all existing cloud providers, \eg, Microsoft, Amazon and VMWare,
have been deploying software-based NFs on servers to
maximize the flexibility~\cite{albert-ons, vmware-multi-tenancy}.
%
%have implemented \textit{virtualized} network functions in hypervisor software on every server to maximize the flexibility, 
%ranging from tunning, load balancing, traffic shaping, and security (\eg, firewall)~\cite{albert-ons, vmware-multi-tenancy}. 
% note: we may need to add citation to AWS later
% limitation of software network functions
However, software NFs have two fundamental limitations -- both stem 
from the nature of software packet processing.   
% capacity
First, processing packets in software has limited capacity. 
% 
Existing software NFs usually require multiple cores to achieve 10~Gbps rate~\cite{comb, martins2014clickos}. 
But the latest network links have scaled up to 40\approx100~Gbps~\cite{mellanox-100g}. 
Although one could add more cores in a server, doing so adds significant cost,  
not only in terms of capital expense, but also more operational expense as they are burning significantly more energy. 
%
Second, processing packets in software incurs large, and highly variable latency. This latency may range 
from tens of microsecond to milliseconds~\cite{martins2014clickos, ananta, duet}. 
For many low latency applications (\eg, stock trading), this inflated latency is unacceptable. 

% hardware accelerating
To overcome the limitations of software packet processing while retaining flexibility,
recent work has proposed accelerating NFs using  
Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)~\cite{packetshader}, network processors (NPs)~\cite{cavium, netronome},
or reconfigurable hardware (\ie, Field Programmable Gate Arrays, or FPGAs)~\cite{netfpga, smartnic, rubow2010chimpp}.
% brief comparisons
Compared to GPU, FPGA is more power-efficient~\cite{fpga-vs-gpu,fpga-vs-gpu2}. 
Compared to specialized NPs, FPGA is more \textit{versatile} 
as it can be virtually reconfigured with any hardware logic for any service.
Finally, FPGAs are inexpensive and being deployed at scale in datacenters~\cite{smartnic, putnam2014reconfigurable}.

% turning directly to FPGA and its main challenge
In this work, we explore the opportunity to use FPGA to accelerate software NFs in datacenters.
The main challenge to use FPGA as an accelerator is \textit{programmability}. 
% HDL
Conventionally, FPGAs are programmed with hardware description 
languages (HDLs), such as Verilog and VHDL, which expose only low
level building blocks like gates, registers, multiplexers and clocks. 
While the programmer can manually tune the logic to achieve maximum performance,
the programming complexity is huge, resulting in low productivity and debugging
difficulties.
%
Indeed, the lack of programmability of FPGA has kept the large community 
of software programmers away from this technology for years~\cite{bacon2013fpga}. 

This paper presents \name, an FPGA-accelerated platform for 
highly flexible and high-performance NF processing 
on commodity servers. 
%
\name\ addresses the programming challenges of FPGA in three steps.
% programming model
First, \name\ provides a modular architecture, resembling the well-known 
Click model~\cite{kohler2000click}, where a complex network function is 
composed using simple, well-defined elements
\footnote{This is also where our system name, \textit{Click Network Processor}, comes from.}.  
% HLS
Second, \name\ elements are written with a high-level C-like language
 and are cross-platform. 
\name\ elements can be compiled into binaries on CPU or 
low-level hardware description language (HDL) for FPGAs, by
leveraging commercial high-level synthesis (HLS) tools~\cite{vivado, aoc, sdaccel}. 
%
% PCIE I/O, compute partitioning, and debugging
Finally, we develop a high-performance PCIE I/O channel that provides 
high-throughput and low latency communications between elements running on CPU 
and FPGA.
This PCIE I/O channel not only enables joint CPU-FPGA processing -- allowing programmers to 
partition their processing freely, but also is of great help for debugging, 
as a programmer may easily run an element in question on the host 
and use familiar software tools to diagnose. 

%While similar approaches have been tried before, \name\
%achieves more than two orders of magnitude performance improvements compared to previous work~\cite{Click2NetFPGA}.
% optimization of FPGA programming and performance
\name\ employs a set of optimization techniques to effectively utilize 
the massive parallelisms in FPGA. 
%while completely programming in high-level language. 
% divide and conque
First of all, \name\ organizes each element into a logic block in FPGA and 
connects them with first-in-first-out (FIFO) buffers.
Therefore, all these element blocks can run in full parallel.
% minimize the dependency
For each element, the processing function is carefully written to minimize the dependency among 
operations, which allows the HLS tools to generate maximum parallel logics.
Further, we develop \textit{delayed write} and \textit{memory scattering} techniques to address
the read-write dependency and pseudo-memory dependency, which cannot be resolved by existing HLS tools.
% memory
Finally, we carefully balance the operations in different stages and match their processing speed, 
so that the overall throughput of pipelines is maximized. 
% results
With all these optimizations, \name\ achieves high packet processing throughput 
up to 200 million packets per second~\footnote{The actual throughput of a \name\ NF may be bound by the Ethernet port data rate.}, with ultra-low latency ($< 2\mu$s for any packet size in most applications).
% summarize the comparison of results
This is about a 10x and 2.5x throughput gain, compared to state-of-the-art software NFs on CPU and CPU with GPU acceleration~\cite{packetshader}, 
while reducing the latency by 10x and 100x, respectively.

% implementation
We have implemented the \name\ tool-chain, which can integrate with various commercial HLS tools~\cite{vivado, aoc}. 
%including Altera OpenCL SDK, Xilinx Vivado and SDAccel. 
% elements
We have implemented about 100 common elements, 20\% of which are re-factored straightforwardly from Click. 
We use these elements to build five demonstration NFs: 
(1) a high-speed traffic capture and generator, 
(2) a firewall supporting both exact and wildcard matching, 
(3) an IPSec gateway,
(4) a Layer-4 load balancer that can handle 32 million concurrent flows, 
and (5) a pFabric scheduler~\cite{pfabric} that performs strict priority flow scheduling with 4-giga priority classes.
%
We evaluate these network functions on a testbed with 
Dell servers and Altera Stratix V FPGA boards~\cite{putnam2014reconfigurable}.
Our results show that all of these NFs can be greatly accelerated by FPGA and saturate the line rate of 40Gbps at 
any packet size with very low latency and neglectable CPU overhead.  

In summary, the contributions of this paper are: 
(1) the design and implementation of \name\ language and tool-chain; 
(2) the design and implementation of high-performance packet processing modules that are running efficiently on FPGA; 
(3) the design and evaluation of five FPGA-accelerated NFs. 
To the best of our knowledge, \name\ is the first FPGA-accelerated packet processing platform for general network functions, 
written completely in high-level language and achieving a 40~Gbps line rate.

The flow: 

Cloud services demand more and more capability. Trend in networking technologies: 40G \arrow 100G~\cite{mellanox-100g}.

Multi-tenancy cloud pushes the network edge/functions to end host~\cite{albert-ons, vmware-multi-tenancy}

Implementing network functions in software (or network function virtualization). Downsides: 1) performance (throughput and latency); and 2) cost (count \# of CPU in use). 

What are the network functions in mind?
\begin{itemize}
\item tunning
\item traffic shaping (rate limiters, load balancer)
\item security (firewall, crypto)
\item management and monitoring
\end{itemize}â€¢


Hardware acceleration is needed. 1) GPU ~\cite{packetshader}; 2) FPGA \cite{netfpga, lockwood2007netfpga} \cite{smartnic}
We also need to mention FPGA is cost efficient~\cite{putnam2014reconfigurable}.

However, the programmability of FPGA is low. High-level Synthesizer could help. ~\cite{bacon2013fpga, feist2012vivado, auerbach2010lime, czajkowski2012opencl, Click2NetFPGA}. 
But these tools are either hard to use for software programmer, or do not have a right interface for network processing.

Why not just use OpenCL?
\begin{itemize}
\item OpenCL is originally designed to allow host program to execute a function (called kernel) on the accelerating devices.
\item With pipe object OpenCL can be used for streaming processing of packet flows, but very cumbersome, requiring manually allocating, distributing and deallocating pipe objects.
\item Code-reuse.  Hard to reuse code.
\end{itemize}â€¢

Programming abstraction: Click model. Familiar, well modeling the packet processing flow.
Key features:
\begin{itemize}
\item elements can be executed in both CPU or FPGA. good for debugging.

\end{itemize}â€¢


Key optimizations in FPGA:
\begin{itemize}
\item memory dependency avoidance. 1) buffer registers; 2) memory stripping; 3) dependency among processing pipelines (?) 
\item Unroll and code expansion. We need maximal iteration loop. (indeterminate, dynamically determined). 
\item Explicit pipelining (control the size of combination logic)
\end{itemize}â€¢

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section \ref{clicknp:sec:background} walks through network processor architectures and programming challenges of FPGA, then propose design goals of ClickNP. Section \ref{clicknp:sec:architecture} illustrates the FPGA hardware platform we work on, and provides an overview of the ClickNP toolchain. In addition to programming abstractions for writing elements in OpenCL (section \ref{clicknp:sec:language}), we have also built a library of generic elements (section \ref{clicknp:sec:elements}) including basic connectors, packet parsers, lookup tables, packet modifications and traffic schedulers, which can be linked as a data flow graph using Click-like syntax to perform comprehensive network functions. We evaluate our work via several high performance network applications (section \ref{clicknp:sec:impl_eval}) built with ClickNP framework. Finally we discuss future works (section \ref{clicknp:sec:future}) and conclude (section \ref{clicknp:sec:conclusion}).
