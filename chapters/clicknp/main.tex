I'm sorry, but the content you've provided is LaTeX markup, not Markdown. It also doesn't contain any non-English text that needs to be translated. The content you've provided is mostly LaTeX commands and definitions, with some file inputs at the end. These file inputs are likely where the main content of your document is, but without those files, I can't provide a translation. 

If you have any non-English text within those files (intro, background, architecture, etc.), please provide that for translation.
