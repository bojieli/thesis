\section{Chapter Summary}
\label{clicknp:sec:conclusion}

This chapter introduced \name, an FPGA acceleration platform for highly flexible and high-performance network functions in commercial servers. \name is fully programmable in a high-level language and provides a modular architecture familiar to software programmers in the network domain. \name supports joint CPU / FPGA packet processing and has high performance. Evaluation shows that compared with the most advanced software network functions, \name increases the throughput of network functions by 10 times and reduces latency by 10 times. This chapter presented a specific case, showing that FPGA can accelerate network functions in data centers. This chapter confirmed that high-level language programming on FPGA is actually feasible and practical.
