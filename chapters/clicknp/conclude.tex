% compile time?

This paper presents \name, an FPGA-accelerated platform for highly flexible 
and high-performance NFs in commodity servers.
\name\ is completely programmable using high-level language and provides a 
modular architecture familiar to software programmers in the networking field.
\name\ supports joint CPU/FPGA packet processing and has high performance.
Our evaluations show that \name\ improves the throughput of NFs by 10x compared to
state-of-the-art software NFs, while alos reducing latency by 10x.
%
Our work makes a concrete case showing FPGA is capable for accelerating NFs in datacenters.
Also, we demonstrate that high-level programming for FPGA is actually feasible and practical. 
%
One limitation of FPGA programming, however, is that the compilation time is rather long, \eg, 1\approx 2 hours, largely
due to HDL synthesis tools.
% cross platform
\name\ alleviates this pain with its cross-platform ability, and hopes most bugs 
could be detected by running elements on CPU.
However, in the long term, HDL synthesis tools should be optimized to greatly 
shorten their compilation time.
