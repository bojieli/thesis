The content you've provided is LaTeX commands, not prose that can be translated into English. These commands are used to define new commands in LaTeX for ease of use in the document. For example, \newcommand{\KB}{~KB} defines a new command \KB that will insert "~KB" into the document wherever \KB is used. 

Since these are not sentences or phrases, they cannot be translated into English. They are already in a form that is standard for LaTeX documents, which is a typesetting system used to create documents with high-quality typography. It is widely used for academic and scientific documents. 

If you have any prose in your document that needs to be translated into English, please provide that.
