\section{Chapter Summary}
\label{kvdirect:sec:conclusion}

This chapter describes the design and evaluation of \oursys{}, a high-performance in-memory key-value store. In the long history of computer system design, \oursys{} is another exercise in leveraging reconfigurable hardware to accelerate important workloads. \oursys{} is able to achieve exceptional performance by carefully designing hardware and software to eliminate bottlenecks in the system and achieve performance close to the physical limits of the underlying hardware.
