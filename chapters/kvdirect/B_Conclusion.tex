\section{Conclusion}
\label{kvdirect:sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we describe the design and evaluation of \oursys{}, a high performance in-memory key-value store. Following a long history in computer system design, \oursys{} is another exercise in leveraging reconfigurable hardware to accelerate an important workload. \oursys{} is able to obtain superior performance by carefully co-designing hardware and software in order to remove bottlenecks in the system and achieve performance that is close to the physical limits of the underlying hardware.

After years of broken promises, FPGA-based reconfigurable hardware  finally becomes widely available in main stream data centers. Many significant workloads will be scrutinized to see whether they can benefit from reconfigurable hardware, and we expect much more fruitful work in this general direction.
